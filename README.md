## About MGVs

We’re **MGVs**, a non-profit founded by a group of Portuguese teenagers who believe education should be open and truly work for everyone.

Our goal is to promote **accessibility** in two major ways:

- **Learning accessibility** — helping education adapt to different realities, neurodivergence, and learning styles  
- **Tool + resource accessibility** — making sure people can actually *reach* the materials and tech they need  

We also explore how technology can help create a more inclusive and adapted society.  
We want to break barriers, open opportunities, and build a future where anyone, anywhere, can learn in their own way.

> **Everyone is too different for the world not to adapt.**

## Our Projects

### 🦽 The “WillChair” Project
The **WillChair** project began as a challenge proposed by one of our robotics teachers, who has limited mobility and uses a wheelchair.

He asked us to develop a **rear camera system** for his wheelchair to assist with navigation.

We enthusiastically accepted the challenge and decided to go further:  
we designed modular upgrades for the wheelchair, including:

- a built-in speaker  
- independent internet connectivity  
- modular expansion upgrades for future accessibility tools

### 🧠 Our approach to cognitive evaluation
This project began from our frustration with the imprecision of traditional IQ tests.

We wanted an **open, mathematically sound** model — one that includes:

- creativity  
- practical skills  
- neurodivergence  
- and above all: **social adversity + context**  

Inspired by the **Multidimensional Human Development Index**, we designed a flexible cognitive index that adjusts for educational inequality and systemic context.

Because this project is more theoretical than something like WillChair, we’ve invited professionals to validate and refine our work.  
As we make progress, we will update this page with new developments.
